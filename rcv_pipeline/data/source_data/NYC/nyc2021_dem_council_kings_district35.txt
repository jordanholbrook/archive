*The winning candidate is the candidate in the round with final 2 candidates who has the most votes.
**Two or more candidates with the lowest number of votes can be eliminated in a single round if their total number of votes is less than
the votes for the candidate immediately ahead of them. This means that, if all next choices went to one of them, they would still trail
the next higher candidate, and the outcome will be the same whether they are eliminated one by one, or at the same time.
