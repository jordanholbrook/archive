RCV City Attorney Nov 2005
Only one candidate has qualified to have his name on the ballot for the City Attorney contest, and there are no qualified write-in candidates for this contest. As there is only one candidate, there is no need to use the run-off tabulation to determine the winner. What follows is information about the one qualified candidate only.

Please note that the Department of Elections printed ballots for this contest with a first-choice, second-choice and third-choice column, even though there is only one qualified candidate, because the deadline for printing ballots passed before the deadline for qualifying as a write-in candidate. Because it was impossible to know whether there would be write-in candidates for this contest at the time ballots were printed, and because the Department must provide for the possibility of write-in candidates, the ballots include a first-choice, second-choice and third-choice column for this contest.
