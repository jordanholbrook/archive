* A candidate must receive a majority of valid votes to be elected. If no candidate reaches a majority of
first choice votes, an instant runoff is triggered. The ballots marked first choice for candidate(s) with the
fewest first choice votes are reviewed to see if they selected a second choice. If so, those ballots are
redistributed to their second choice candidate. If their second choice is defeated or if they did not select
a second choice, those ballots are declared “exhausted.”
