# Data Sources and Provenance: ARCHIVE Database

The ARCHIVE database aggregates ranked-choice voting (RCV) election results from 514 American elections (2004–2024). 

**A comprehensive metadata file, `Source_Metadata.csv`, accompanies this database. It contains the primary source URLs utilized during the 2024–2025 data collection period.**


## Persistence and Reproducibility Disclaimer
The URLs provided in `Source_Metadata.csv` were active and verified at the time of data collection. However, users should note:
1. **URL Volatility:** Jurisdictions frequently restructure their web portals or archive past results to new subdirectories. Consequently, some original links may become inactive over time. 
2. **Aggregated Reporting:** Several jurisdictions report multiple race results on a single landing page; in these cases, the landing page is the recorded source for all associated elections in the database.
3. **Archival Stability:** To ensure long-term reproducibility, the ARCHIVE database stores a version of the raw tabulated data, which remains the main source data reference.
